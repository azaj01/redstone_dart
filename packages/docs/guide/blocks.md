# Blocks

Blocks are the heart of most Minecraft mods. In Redstone.Dart, you define block **behavior** in Dart while the actual block object lives in Java.

## The Proxy Pattern

When you create a `CustomBlock`, you're not creating a Minecraft block directly. You're defining:

1. **Metadata** — ID, hardness, light level, texture
2. **Behavior** — What happens when players interact with it

During registration, Redstone creates a "proxy block" in Java that forwards all interactions to your Dart code. This separation is what enables hot reload—the Java proxy stays constant while your Dart behavior can change.

## Creating a Block

```dart
class HelloBlock extends CustomBlock {
  HelloBlock() : super(
    id: 'mymod:hello_block',
    settings: BlockSettings(hardness: 2.0, resistance: 6.0),
    model: BlockModel.cubeAll(texture: 'assets/textures/block/hello.png'),
  );

  @override
  ActionResult onUse(int worldId, int x, int y, int z, int playerId, int hand) {
    Players.getPlayer(playerId)?.sendMessage('§aHello!');
    return ActionResult.success;
  }
}
```

The `id` follows Minecraft's `namespace:path` convention. Your mod's namespace (like `mymod`) keeps your blocks separate from other mods.

## Registration and the Main Function

Your `main()` function sets up the Dart↔Minecraft bridge:

```dart
void main() {
  // 1. Initialize the bridge to Java
  Bridge.initialize();

  // 2. Set up callback routing for block interactions
  Events.registerProxyBlockHandlers();

  // 3. Register your blocks (creates Java proxies)
  BlockRegistry.register(HelloBlock());

  // 4. Signal that registration is complete
  BlockRegistry.freeze();
}
```

**Why these steps?**

- `Bridge.initialize()` — Opens the communication channel to Java. Without this, nothing works.
- `Events.registerProxyBlockHandlers()` — Tells the native bridge how to route block events back to Dart. Without this, your `onUse()` etc. would never be called.
- `BlockRegistry.freeze()` — Minecraft's registry freezes early in startup. This mirrors that constraint and ensures you don't try to register blocks too late.

## Block Settings

Settings define the physical properties of your block:

```dart
BlockSettings(
  hardness: 2.0,        // How long to mine (stone = 1.5, obsidian = 50)
  resistance: 6.0,      // Explosion resistance
  luminance: 15,        // Light emitted (0-15, glowstone = 15)
  requiresTool: true,   // Must use correct tool to get drops
  ticksRandomly: true,  // Receives random ticks (for crops, decay)
  slipperiness: 0.6,    // Surface friction (ice = 0.98)
)
```

These are set once at registration and can't be changed via hot reload—they're stored in Java.

## Callbacks

Callbacks define behavior. These **can** be hot reloaded because they're just Dart methods.

### onUse — Player Right-Clicks

```dart
@override
ActionResult onUse(int worldId, int x, int y, int z, int playerId, int hand) {
  // Return success to indicate you handled the interaction
  // Return pass to let other handlers try
  // Return fail to indicate interaction failed
  return ActionResult.success;
}
```

### onBreak — Player Breaks Block

```dart
@override
bool onBreak(int worldId, int x, int y, int z, int playerId) {
  // Return true to allow breaking
  // Return false to prevent it
  return true;
}
```

### onSteppedOn — Entity Walks On Block

```dart
@override
void onSteppedOn(int worldId, int x, int y, int z, int entityId) {
  // entityId could be a player or any mob
  // Use Players.getPlayer(entityId) - returns null if not a player
}
```

### randomTick — Random Game Ticks

For blocks that change over time (crops growing, fire spreading):

```dart
// Must enable in settings
settings: BlockSettings(ticksRandomly: true)

@override
void randomTick(int worldId, int x, int y, int z) {
  // Called randomly, not every tick
}
```

## Working with IDs

Callbacks receive raw IDs, not objects. This is efficient but means you need to wrap them:

```dart
@override
ActionResult onUse(int worldId, int x, int y, int z, int playerId, int hand) {
  // Wrap the player ID to get a Player object
  final player = Players.getPlayer(playerId);
  if (player == null) return ActionResult.fail;

  // Now you can use player methods
  player.sendMessage('Hello!');

  return ActionResult.success;
}
```

The wrapping is lightweight—`Player` is just a thin wrapper that makes JNI calls using the ID.

## Textures

Place 16x16 PNG files in `assets/textures/block/`. The CLI automatically copies them to the right Minecraft location.

```
assets/
└── textures/
    └── block/
        └── hello.png
```

Reference them in your block model:

```dart
model: BlockModel.cubeAll(texture: 'assets/textures/block/hello.png')
```
