# Events

There are two ways to respond to things happening in Minecraft: **block callbacks** and **global events**.

## Block Callbacks vs Global Events

**Block callbacks** (like `onUse`, `onBreak`) only fire for *your* custom blocks. They're routed by handler ID—when a player clicks your `HelloBlock`, Minecraft calls the proxy, which looks up the handler ID and calls *your* `onUse` method.

**Global events** fire for *everything* in the game. When *any* block breaks (yours, vanilla, other mods), the `onBlockBreak` event fires.

Use block callbacks for block-specific behavior. Use global events for game-wide logic.

## Global Events

Register event handlers in your `main()` function:

```dart
void main() {
  Bridge.initialize();
  Events.registerProxyBlockHandlers();

  // Global events
  Events.onPlayerJoin((player) {
    player.sendMessage('§aWelcome to the server!');
  });

  Events.onBlockBreak((x, y, z, playerId) {
    // Called for ANY block in the game
    return EventResult.allow;
  });

  BlockRegistry.freeze();
}
```

### Available Events

**Player Events:**
- `Events.onPlayerJoin((player) { })` — Player enters the game
- `Events.onPlayerLeave((player) { })` — Player exits the game

**Block Events:**
- `Events.onBlockBreak((x, y, z, playerId) { })` — Any block broken
- `Events.onBlockPlace((x, y, z, playerId) { })` — Any block placed

**Game Events:**
- `Events.onTick(() { })` — Every game tick (20/second)

### The Tick Event

`onTick` runs 20 times per second. It's powerful but dangerous—expensive code here causes lag for everyone.

```dart
var tickCount = 0;

Events.onTick(() {
  tickCount++;

  // Do something every second (20 ticks)
  if (tickCount % 20 == 0) {
    // This is fine
  }

  // DON'T do expensive operations every tick
  // for (player in allPlayers) { for (block in nearbyBlocks) { ... } }
});
```

### Cancelling Events

Some events can be cancelled:

```dart
Events.onBlockBreak((x, y, z, playerId) {
  final player = Players.getPlayer(playerId);

  // Prevent breaking bedrock
  if (world.getBlock(x, y, z) == 'minecraft:bedrock') {
    player?.sendMessage('§cYou cannot break bedrock!');
    return EventResult.deny;
  }

  return EventResult.allow;
});
```

## When to Use Which

| Situation | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| Custom block interaction | Block callback (`onUse`) |
| Prevent breaking specific blocks | Global event (`onBlockBreak`) |
| Welcome message on join | Global event (`onPlayerJoin`) |
| Block that damages nearby players | Block callback (`randomTick` or `onTick`) |
| Track all player deaths | Global event |

## One Handler Per Event

Unlike some event systems, Redstone only keeps **one handler per event type**. If you call `Events.onPlayerJoin()` twice, the second handler replaces the first.

If you need multiple handlers, combine them:

```dart
Events.onPlayerJoin((player) {
  welcomePlayer(player);
  giveStarterKit(player);
  logJoin(player);
});
```
